README

CS-204 project, RISC-V SIMULATOR, GROUP1:-

Ishika Soni-2017eeb1145
Harsha Garg-2017meb1008
Vishal Lunia-2017eeb1177
Sujit Jaiswaliya-2017csb1115

Language:- C++


HOW TO RUN:-
        
        On the terminal :-
         g++ main.cpp
        ./a.out
        
       GUI:-  Qt framework
            Editor pane , Highlighting the data forwarding path, Identification of data Hazard , Identification of Control Hazard,     Register and Inter state Registers value after every cycle, Branch Predictor result, Dealing with three different cases for 1.without pipelining, 2.pipelining without data forwarding and 3.pipelining with data forwarding

Phase 3:-
If all the errors are not cleared, Error message will be written on the terminal and complete machine code will not be available.
Our assembler accepts instructions without bracket for offset 

Contribution:
-GUI : Harsha and Ishika
Phase3: lakshya(pipeline and 1 bit prediction ,  Highlighting the data forwarding path, Identification of data Hazard , Identification of Control Hazard,     Register and Inter state Registers value after every cycle, Branch Predictor result, Dealing with three different cases for 1.without pipelining, 2.pipelining without data forwarding and 3.pipelining with data forwarding
